# Button-Controlled-LED-System
 A simple Arduino project that controls three LEDs using three separate push buttons. Each button activates a specific LED for 3 seconds. Ideal for learning digital input/output operations.
# Button-Controlled LED System 💡🔘

## 🔧 Tech & Tools

- **Platform:** Arduino (or any microcontroller)
- **Language:** C/C++ (Arduino IDE)
- **Components Used:**
  - LED
  - Push Button
  - Resistors
  - Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## 🎯 What It Does

When the button is pressed:
- The LED turns ON  
When the button is released:
- The LED turns OFF

This project demonstrates basic control flow, digital input/output, and hardware interaction.

## 📍 Use Cases

- Learning embedded systems
- Practicing GPIO logic
- Intro to physical computing

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Connect the button and LED to the board as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the code from `led_button.ino` using Arduino IDE.
3. Press the button to test the functionality.

## 🚧 In Progress

- Adding a debounce function
- Testing with multiple LEDs and states
- Documenting the circuit diagram

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- GPIO pin control using C++
- Hardware-software interaction
- Importance of clean circuit design
